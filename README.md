In the first part of this activity, we were tasked with looking at monthly profit data and analyzing that data.

Using the 86 months worth of data, I determined the total net profits were $22.56 million with an average net monthly change of $8,311. The month with the greatest increase in profits was August 2016 with a $1.86 million increase in profits from July. The month with the greatest decrease in profits was February 2014 with a $1.83 million decrease in profits from January.

The second ask was to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process to tabulate results for the 369,711 votes cast.

Using these votes, I determined there are 3 candidates in the election and calculated the number of votes (and percent of total votes) each received. Based on these results, the winner with nearly 74% of the votes is Diana DeGette.
